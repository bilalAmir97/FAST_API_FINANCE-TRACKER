## 🔌 AI API Endpoints

These endpoints power the AI-native features. All routes are mounted under the `/api` prefix by `main.py`.

- `POST /api/analyze-transaction`
  - Request body: `{ "note": "Pizza with friends" }`
  - Response: `{ "note", "category", "tip" }` for a single transaction note.
- `GET /api/spending-summary/{username}`
  - Aggregates recent outflows for the user, finds the **highest spending category**, and returns a single one-line tip.
  - Used by the Dashboard and History pages to display the AI Spending Insight.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**1. Frontend Not Loading** - Clear cache with Ctrl+Shift+R
**2. CORS Errors** - Check middleware added BEFORE static mounting
**3. API 404** - Use /api prefix for all backend routes
**4. Railway Deploy Fails** - Verify requirements.txt and Python 3.10+
